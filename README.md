## 📌 Abstract
- Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide.  
- Early detection and accurate diagnosis play a crucial role in saving lives.  
- This project implements a **machine learning–based breast cancer prediction system** using patient diagnostic data.  
- The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Target
- ✅ Predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using diagnostic features.  
- ✅ Apply preprocessing and feature selection for better performance.  
- ✅ Train and evaluate machine learning models with accuracy metrics.  
- ✅ Provide a reusable pipeline for prediction.  

---

## 📊 Metrics Required
- 📌 **Accuracy** → Overall correctness of predictions.  
- 📌 **Precision** → Fraction of predicted malignant cases that were correct.  
- 📌 **Recall** → Fraction of actual malignant cases correctly identified.  
- 📌 **F1-score** → Balance between precision and recall.  
- 📌 **Confusion Matrix** → To visualize classification results.

## 🤖 Breast Cancer Prediction Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values  
- Scale features using **RobustScaler**  
- Feature selection with **SelectKBest (chi-squared test)**  

### 2. Model Training
- Random Forest Classifier 🌲  
- Neural Network (MLP Classifier) 🧠  

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- **GridSearchCV**  
- **RandomizedSearchCV**  

### 4. Prediction
- Model predicts whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant**.
